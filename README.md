# 1. Motivaton and overview of the project
House price is highly concerned by people who are looking for places to live or opportunities to invest. Actually, housing expenses takes 30% of our daily expenses. It is easy to know the price of a house, but difficult to know whether the price is reasonable or not

<p align="center">

</p>

In fact, many factors influence housing price, such as the area of the house, the number of bedrooms, the location et. al. Therefore, in this project, we will focus on the following three aspects related to house price, which is important to help us make a good deal:  
1. Select the features that have impact on house price with recursive feature selection (RFE) and Random Forest
2. Build house price prediction model using linear regression and neural network with different house features. 
3. House recommendation based on consumersâ€™ preference with k-neareat neighbor method (K-NN)

# 2. Dataset and visulization 

### (1). Dataset: House Sales in King County (from Kaggle)
#### Features in the dataset: 21 features in total
1. id: notation for a house  
2. date: date house was sold  
3. price: the sell price of the house, which is what we need to predict
4. bedrooms: Number of Bedrooms/House
5. bathrooms: Number of bathrooms/House  
6. sqft_living: square footage of the home  
7. sqft_lot: square footage of the lot  
8. floorsTotal: floors (levels) in house  
9. waterfront: House which has a view to a waterfront  
10. view: how many time it has been viewd consumers?  
11. condition: How good the condition is (Overall)  
12. grade: overall grade given to the housing unit, based on King County grading system  
13. sqft_above: square footage of house apart from basement

20. sqft_living15: Living room area in 2015 This might or might not have affected the lotsize area  
21. sqft_lot15: lot size area in 2015  

### (2). dataset visulization
#### Feature distribution
15 features are visulized as below. The features has the following characteristics: 
1. The scale of each feature is quite different, which means normalization is needed
2. There are continuos variables (sqrf_lot et.al), dicreste variables (bedrooms) and categorical variable (grade,yr_renovated)

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/yandongluo/HousingPricePrediction/blob/master/Figures/Feature_Dist.PNG">
</p>

#### Correlation Heat Map

To find out how each feature is correlated to our target variable "price", the Pearson correation matrix is drawn below as a heat map. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/xiaochen76/CX4240-Project-House-Price-Predict/blob/master/Figures/HeatMap_ALL.PNG" width="500"/>
</p>

The features with correlation coefficients close to +1 or -1 with price may have higher impact on house price. Those with correlation efficients close to 0 may be irrelevent to house price. Besides, if two features have high correlation, one of them may be redundant. 

The correlation matrix with features that is highly correlated with "price" is drawn below

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/xiaochen76/CX4240-Project-House-Price-Predict/blob/master/Figures/HeatMap_select.PNG" width="500"/>
</p>

From the above results, the features that are high correlated with house price are: bathrooms, bedrooms, floors, grade, sqft_above, sqft_living and sqft_living15.

A pairplots is drawn to visualize the relationship between different features. The pairplots shows how "bathrooms", "bedrooms" and "sqft_living" are distributed vis-a-vis the price as well as the "grade", which means the grading of the houses by the local real estate agency. The pairplots shows that some features are either linearly or quadraticlly correlated with "price", which indicates that a linear or polynomial regression model can be helpful for house price prediction.

# 3. Data pre-processing
After the dataset is visulized and examined, the data is processed in following ways: 
1. remove irrelevant features: id, date, lat, long, zipcode
2. remove the feature "waterfront" as it is 0 for all the data points
3. normalize the all the features with its mean and sigma as their scale is quite different
4. There is a categorical feature: yr_renovated. It is either 0 or the year that it has been renovated. It is treat as a dummy variable with only two values: "1" if the house has been renovated and "0" if it has not.

# 4. Feature selection 

In this section, two feature selection methods to find the features that highly influences the house price: the recursive feature elimination (RFE) and random forest based feature selection. The RFE method start with a complete set of features and it reursively remove one feature to evaluate the importance of this feature. It stops until the number of desired features is obtained.  

From the results of RFE below, some categorical features such as grade (evaluated from local real estate agency) and condition are ranked high. Besides, the number of bedroom, bathrooms ranks higher than the area of the bedroom, bathrooms. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/xiaochen76/CX4240-Project-House-Price-Predict/blob/master/Figures/FeatureImp_RFE.PNG" width="400"/>
</p>

In random forest model, similar as RFE, the categorical features such as grade are ranked high. However, different from RFE, the area of the rooms are more import from random forest model. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/xiaochen76/CX4240-Project-House-Price-Predict/blob/master/Figures/FeatureImp_RF.PNG" width="400"/>
</p>

To get a more balanced feature ranking, we normalized the scores from each model and get the mean values, the final feature ranking is shown as below:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/xiaochen76/CX4240-Project-House-Price-Predict/blob/master/Figures/FeatureImp_Average.PNG" width="400"/>
</p>

Therefore, it can be concluded that the features has high impact on house price are: grade, the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and whether the house has been renovated. 

# 5. Housing price prediction with linear regression

<img src="https://github.com/xiaochen76/CX4240-Project-House-Price-Predict/blob/master/Figures/Price_Bathrooms.PNG" width="280"/> <img src="https://github.com/xiaochen76/CX4240-Project-House-Price-Predict/blob/master/Figures/Price_Bedrooms.PNG" width="280"/><img src="https://github.com/xiaochen76/CX4240-Project-House-Price-Predict/blob/master/Figures/Price_SqLiving.PNG" width="280"/>

As what we have shown in the dataset analysis, some features shows a classical linear relationship, while others show a quanratic relation with house price. In this section, both the linear and polynomial regression model are impelemented for house price prediction. 

After data pre-processing as we mentioned above, there are 14 features left in the dataset. An the dataset is divided into training and testing set. With linear regression, when the number of features is too low, it could suffer from under-fitting, and get poor performance in both training and testing, while if there are too many features, over-fitting may likely to happen. To learn about the number of features in the linear regression, we have run linear and polynomial regression, based on three models (linear regression, ridge regression and lasso regression), with all the 14 features and only top-10 important features. 

In ridge regression, it shrinks the coefficients (w) by putting L2 norm on them and therefore, helps to reduce the model complexity and multi-collinearity. Similarly, in lasso regression, the regularization will lead to zero coefficients, which means some of the features are completely neglected for the evaluation of output. 

### (1). ALL Features Included

As the figure shown below, where red line is the real price value, and the blue dots are the predicted price value. The first row shows the linear, lasso and ridge regression without polynomial, the second row shows when polynomial in introduced with degree equals to 2, and the third is with degree equals to 3. It shows that, with polynomial, the prediction achieves better performance, since it can help to fit in non-linear features.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/xiaochen76/CX4240-Project-House-Price-Predict/blob/master/Figures/Predict_All.PNG">
</p>

### (2). Selected Top-10 Features Included

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/xiaochen76/CX4240-Project-House-Price-Predict/blob/master/Figures/Predict.PNG">
</p>

The figure shown above is the relation between real price and predicted price, when we only introduced the top-10 important features. The first column shows the linear, ridge and lasso regression, and the second column shows the ones with polynomial (degree is set to 2). Similarly as what we have found in the "all features included" method, the linear regression achieves best performance among all the three linear models.

### (3). Comparison and Discussion

It is shown that Lasso and Ridge regression shows lower RMSE, which indicates more accurate prediction due to less over-fitting. Besides, polynomial regression with 2nd order features shows the lower RMSE loss.  

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/xiaochen76/CX4240-Project-House-Price-Predict/blob/master/Figures/RMSE.PNG" width="400"/>
</p>

Selecting all the features for regression shows slightly lower RMSE than select 10 features. It can be explained that the number of features in this dataset is small (21 in total) and therefore there is no over-fitting by using all the features. 

# 6. Housing price prediction with neural netwok

</p>

### (1). neural network vs linear regression
A 2-layer neural network with fully connected layer is implemented for house price prediction. The hidden layer unit is 64, the activation function at the hidden layer is ReLU and the output is the house price. The prediction is evaluated with root-mean-squred-error (RMSE) of the predicted house price. The neural network is trained with 20 epoch.  
First, the RMSE obtained by neural network method is compared with that of linear regression, as shown in the figure below. Neural network shows lower loss than all the linear regression based methods, which indicates that it can be a good model for house price prediction.

<p align="center">

</p>

## prediction loss vs. number of hidden units
Then we examined the prediction loss with different neural network settings. The prediction loss of the neural network can be decreased by increasing the number of hidden units, as shown in the figure below. It means that a more complicated model is desired for this task

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/yandongluo/HousingPricePrediction/blob/master/Figures/Loss_vs_hidden_units.png" width="400"/>
</p>

## prediction loss vs. activation function
Three different activation functions are examined ReLU, Sigmoid and Tanh. The results shows that prediction loss is small when "ReLU" is used while the prediction loss is large when the activation is Sigmoid or Tanh. The prediction loss vs. training epoch is plotted. The neural networks with Sigmoid and Tanh shows slow training as the neuron activation value is limited, which is (0,1) for Sigmoid and (-1,1) for Tanh

</p>

## Prediction loss vs. optimizers
The prediction loss of neural network trained with different optimization method are also examined with SGD and RMSprop. RMSprop shows faster convergence and less fluctuations when it is convergent because the learning rate can be varied during the training.

# 7. Housing recommendation with K-NN
The house recommendation is conducted with k-neareast neighbor algorithm to find the house that best matches the consumer's preference, which is measured by the Euclidean distance between the house in the dataset and the preference input by consumer. An example is shown in the table below, where 5 recommendations are made. It is noted that house price is an important factor as recommendations are trying to match the price expected by consumers. As consumers are price sensitive, it indicates the K-NN works well for house recommendation.

# 8. Discussions (the questions in proposal) 
a. Do all the feature ranking methods list the same informative features? And do those features ranked in the same order?  
Answer: No, there are slight difference. In both recursive feature elimination (RFE), the number of rooms has higher importance while in random forest feature ranking, the area of the rooms has higher importance. However, categorical features such as grade (the grad evaluated by agency) are ranked high by both method

b. With the same set of features, which regression model provides the most accurate prediction.  
Answer: Lasso and Ridge regression with polynomial features (degree = 2) provides the most accurate prediction results as it prevents overfitting. 

c. How to choose the proper methods for prediction  
Answer: in this project, neural network shows the smallest rmse loss for prediction. The factors that influence the prediction accuracy are the number of hidden units, activation functions. For house price prediction, hidden units of larger than 64 is preferred and ReLU activation provides faster training and better accuracy

d. Why not use PCA for feature selection  
Answer: Fisrt, PCA is trying to find the feature or dimension with the highest variance. However, in this project, what we would like to find are the features with the highest impact on house price. Features with high variance may not necessarily have high impact on house price. Besides, PCA may create new features on a new dimension, which is not intepretable.  

# 9. Conclusion
