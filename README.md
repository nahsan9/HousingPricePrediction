House price is highly concerned by people that are looking for places to live or opportunities to invest.

In fact, many factors influence housing price, such as the area of the house, the number of bedrooms, the location et. al. Therefore, in this project, we will focus on the following three aspects related to house price, which is important to help us make a good deal:  
1. Find the main factors that influence house price with feature selection methods such as recursive feature selection (RFE) and RandomForest
2. Find the model that can accurately predict house price based on its characteristics.
3. Recommend houses based on consumersâ€™ preference
